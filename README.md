a new analysis which shows what types of generators are producing electricity at different times of day. 

Tip
You can find the highest- and lowest-load hours of the day by finding the average load across each hour. Here is an example:

Hour 1: Load is 2000 MW for 15 minutes and then a blackout occurs (load is 0 MW for the rest of the hour). 2000 * 0.25 = 500
Hour 2: Load is 800 MW for 30 minutes and 700 MW for 30 minutes. 800 * 0.5 + 700 * 0.5 = 750
In this example, Hour 2 is the highest-load hour.
